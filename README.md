# isodate

An incredibly simple commandline tool that outputes the date and time in [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339). The name `isodate` comes from iso 8601. If you want to know the differences between the RFC and ISO spec, check out https://ijmacd.github.io/rfc3339-iso8601/. 

We use Go's hardcoded definition of RFC3339, as seen at https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants
